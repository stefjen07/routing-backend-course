# Module 1. OSM data preparation
## Description
In this module, you will learn how to prepare OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for use in Java backend routing applications. You will start by understanding what OSM is and how it can be used for routing applications. You will then learn how to download OSM data and how to extract the relevant information for your routing application.<br>
Next, you will explore various tools and libraries that can be used to process OSM data, such as Osmium, Osmosis, Osm4j and JOSM. You will learn how to filter and transform OSM data to extract the information you need for routing, such as road networks, intersections, and speed limits.<br>
Finally, you will learn how to store OSM data in a format that is optimized for routing applications, such as a graph data structure. You will also learn how to integrate OSM data with other data sources, such as real-time traffic data, to improve the accuracy of your routing application.<br>
By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of how to prepare OSM data for use in Java backend routing applications.
